          One of the marvelous things about community is that it enables us to
          welcome and help people in a way we couldn’t as individuals. When we
          pool our strength and share the work and responsibility, we can
          welcome many people, even those in deep distress, and perhaps help
          them find self-confidence and inner healing.
